# Text_To_PDF_Service
converts any uploaded text file to a pdf file and let's users download the converted file

The idea behind this project is to create a web service that gives the users the posibility to upload a text file and download the PDF version of that file.
The web service is integrated with Apache Kafka to enable asynchronous processing of pdf files.

The login functionality is based on [this tutorial.](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-add-authentication-to-your-app-with-flask-login)
